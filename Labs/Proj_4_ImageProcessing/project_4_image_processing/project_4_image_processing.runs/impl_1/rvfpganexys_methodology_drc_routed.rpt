No common phase between related clocks from parallel MMCMs or PLLs  
The clocks clk_core and clk_31_5_clk_vga are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel MMCMs or PLLs and at least one of the block's clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all parallel MMCMs or PLLs must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
