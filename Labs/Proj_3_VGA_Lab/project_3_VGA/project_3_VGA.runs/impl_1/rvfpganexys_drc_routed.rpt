2. REPORT DETAILS

BIIVRC-1#1 Warning
Bank IO standard internal Vref conflict  - IOBank:34
Conflicting INTERNAL_VREF constraint in Bank 34.  Some ports in this bank, for example, ddram_dq[0]   (SSTL18_II, Vref=0.900V) 
 at site R7 conflict with constrained INTERNAL_VREF of 0.750V.ddram_dq[0]
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer ddr2/ldc/IOBUFDS/IBUFDS (in ddr2/ldc/IOBUFDS macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer ddr2/ldc/IOBUFDS_1/IBUFDS (in ddr2/ldc/IOBUFDS_1 macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
